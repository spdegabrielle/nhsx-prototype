# NHSX website prototypes

Design prototypes for the NHSX website, made using the NHS.UK prototype kit.

We're testing these designs and content with users at the moment and will be iterating them. None of the content or visuals are finalised yet.

## About the NHS.UK prototype kit

The NHS.UK prototype kit enables you to make interactive prototypes that will look like pages on NHS.UK. The prototypes you make are a great way to show ideas to others and for conducting user research.

Visit the <a href="http://nhsuk-prototype-kit.azurewebsites.net/docs">NHS.UK prototype kit site</a> to download the latest version and read the documentation.

## Security

If you publish your prototypes online, they must be protected by a <a href="http://nhsuk-prototype-kit.azurewebsites.net/docs/how-tos/heroku">username and password</a>. This is to prevent members of the public finding prototypes and thinking they are real services.

You must protect user privacy at all times, even when using prototypes. Prototypes made with the kit look like NHS.UK, but do not have the same security provisions. Always make sure you are handling user data appropriately.
